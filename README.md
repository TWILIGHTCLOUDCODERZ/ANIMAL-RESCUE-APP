## Inspiration

&emsp;&emsp;Inspired by Jane Goodall braved a realm of unknowns to give the world a remarkable window into humankindâ€™s closest living relatives. Through nearly 60 years of groundbreaking work, Dr. Jane Goodall has not only shown us the urgent need to protect chimpanzees from extinction; she has also redefined species conservation to include the needs of local people and the environment. Today she travels the world, speaking about the threats facing chimpanzees and environmental crises, urging each of us to take action on behalf of all living things and planet we share.

&emsp;&emsp;In this project we are addressing about how paperless reduces impact on forests-tress, decreases the amount of waste. Go paperless,Save Trees, Save Earth,
